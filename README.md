# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The purpose of this application is to aid the user with managing their budget. A user can set, edit, and delete monthly goals for multiple spending categories. If they decide to set multiple budgets in the same month and category, the app will account for the repeats and simply sum the budgets. Users can also create or delete expenses for each month with differing categories. You are able to filter through all your goals and expenses to narrow it down.
The app will also display trends of your expenses plotted against monthly goals set, and it updates as the data of goals and expenses are changed. Lastly, the user is able to see 12 monthly spending breakdown pages with pie charts that updates dynamically with expense changes. On each of those pages, the app also informs the user if they succeeded or failed in reaching their goals for that month and by how much. There is also a benchmarks report section next to the goal feedback that analyzes spending ratios that have a default setting, however the user can change the ratios on a month by month basis. Like the goal feedback, the benchmark report changes dynamically based on expenses and if the user changes the percentages from the default. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
